/*
add json print, can help with just printing the gui to console, but also saving and loading the GUI between sessions
add string id's to valuegroup elements so i can GetFloat("xPosSlider") instead of GetFloat(0)

GUI window class, which is a window to which element positions are relative. 
maybe set it up where you can say GUI.SetActiveWindow() to auto draw any elements on that window after

option for element auto spacing. this sounds nice in a way where i don't got to manually move all elements. 
it would be an option per element though, for example the slider array on procedural animation would not be possible

change GetValue script to GetValues script. some elements might have different values you'd want to access.
