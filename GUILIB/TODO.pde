/*

=======================WINDOW========================
non clickthrough windows, window depth. don't think i'll worry about element depth just yet, but might be easy to make if i already have window depth
maskable windows (need to use mask together with a rectangle, i think that would work already
collapsable windows after maskable windows
window menu bar (to drag it, or minimize it, or straight up make it dissapear)
resizable windows
tabs
subwindows

==================GUIELEMENT===========================
try to make it so position for elements does not have to be specified, probably just need to overload constructors.
auto spacing current only works with text TOP alignment

====================SAVE AND LOAD====================
add json print, can help with just printing the gui to console, but also saving and loading the GUI between sessions


==================ELEMENTS===========================
graph element (can call a set value type function, which will graph that value over time)
text element
collapser
dropdown
image
((table))?
