/*

 ==================GENERAL===============
 organize code, put functions in proper order, currently they're all kind of mixed up
 debug draw (called from GUI, draws debug lines over everything, think width/height, total bbox, window spacing lines)
 
 =======================WINDOW========================
 non clickthrough windows, window depth. don't think i'll worry about element depth just yet, but might be easy to make if i already have window depth
 collapsable windows after maskable windows
 window menu bar (to drag it, or minimize it, or straight up make it dissapear)
 resizable windows
 tabs
 subwindows (imagine putting a divider into a window, splitting it up into 2 smaller windows
 
 ==================GUIELEMENT===========================
 
 ==================STYLE===========================
 option for having transparent windows
 
 ====================SAVE AND LOAD====================
 add json print, can help with just printing the gui to console, but also saving and loading the GUI between sessions
 
 
 ==================ELEMENTS===========================
 text element (in progress)
 collapser (this would be like having a header with internal content that can collapse, kind of like the region thing in python, gamemaker or godot
 dropdown (dropdown list of selectable items)
 image (just something to display an image)
 ((table))? (an element that can make columns and have rows with values for those columns, mostly thinking simple data types like integers, floats, booleans or strings)
