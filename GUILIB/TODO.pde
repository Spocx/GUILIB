/*
try to make it so position for elements does not have to be specified, probably just need to overload constructors.

auto spacing current only works with text TOP alignment

option for element auto spacing. this sounds nice in a way where i don't got to manually move all elements. 
it would be an option per element though, for example the slider array on procedural animation would not be possible

add json print, can help with just printing the gui to console, but also saving and loading the GUI between sessions
add string id's to valuegroup elements so i can GetFloat("xPosSlider") instead of GetFloat(0)

change GetValue script to GetValues script. some elements might have different values you'd want to access.
